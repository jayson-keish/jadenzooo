    Crocodiles (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live 
    throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. 
    The term crocodile is sometimes used even more loosely to include 
    all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and 
    caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae) among other extinct 
    taxa.
